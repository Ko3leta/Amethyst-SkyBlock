## ðŸ¦‘ About:
The **Amethyst SkyBlock** DataPack provides an ability to play the most complex and hardcore modification of everyoneâ€™s favorite skyblock minigame. Here you have to survive on a block of budding amethyst... You won't need anything else. Here you are alone with emptiness, boredom and monotonous repetition of the same actions. Test your strength, endurance and knowledge in the field of crafts, mobs and drops with this datapack.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay:
You start with one block below you and empty inventory. Get some amethyst shard and place your first block... Expand your platform, build a mob farm and obtain new and new types of resources, exploring the innovations of this DataPack! **Amethyst** SkyBlock provides the opportunity to go through all stages of the game up to going to the Nether, getting blaze rods and defeating the ender dragon in the End.

## ðŸŒº Multiplayer:
Amethyst SkyBlock allows you to play on the same map with friends. You all can start the game together, or some players can join the game even after you started. The choice is yours!

**Warning**: _Now the multiplayer is unstable. To avoid fatal bugs, DO NOT join the game before survival has started!!!_

## ðŸ“œ How to play:
You only need to create a new superflat world with "The Void" preset and add this DataPack into it... Thats all! If you couldnâ€™t do it yourself, read the Amethyst SkyBlock Installation guide (ENG/RUS).

**Warning**: _DO NOT use cheats, reload resources or change gamerules to avoid fatal bugs!!!_

## ðŸ§­ Future of Amethyst SkyBlock:

- More options
- Some easter eggs
- Gameplay customisation
- More unique crafts and loots
